description: Prohibits creating documentation files about agent work or progress.
alwaysApply: true
---
- NEVER proactively create .md files to document agent tasks, progress, or work completed
- Do not create files like: COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md, TEST_STATUS.md, MIGRATION_GUIDE.md, etc.
- Focus on doing the work, not documenting that you did the work
- Only create documentation files when explicitly requested by the user
- Exception: Creating or updating actual project documentation (like API docs, user guides) when that's the task
